    <fieldset><b>Stratovolcanoes</b>
    <p>Viscosity is important in volcanology. An eruption of highly viscous (very sticky) magma 
        tends to produce steep-sided volcanoes with slopes that are about 30–35°. That’s because the
         viscous volcanic material doesn’t flow that far from where it is erupted, so it builds up in
          layers forming a cone-shaped volcano known as a stratovolcano. Shield volcanoes, on the other hand, 
          have gentle slopes that are less than 10° and erupt more fluid lavas called basalt. When a shield
           volcano erupts, the basalt can flow great distances away from the vent 
        to produce broad, gentle slopes.

        Where a volcano produces low viscosity, runny lava, it spreads far from the source and forms a 
        volcano with gentle slopes: a shield volcano. Most shield volcanoes are formed from fluid, basaltic 
        lava flows. Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa are shield volcanoes. They are the world’s largest active volcanoes, 
        rising over 9 km above the sea floor around the island of Hawai’i.

        Stratovolcanoes have relatively steep sides and are more cone-shaped than shield volcanoes. 
        They are formed from viscous, sticky lava that does not flow easily. The lava therefore builds 
        up around the vent forming a volcano with steep sides. Stratovolcanoes are more likely to produce 
        explosive eruptions due to gas building up in the viscous magma.
        Andesite (named after the Andes Mountains), is perhaps the most common rock type of stratovolcanoes, 
        but stratovolcanoes also erupt a wide range of different rocks in different tectonic settings.
        The Soufrière Hills volcano, on the Caribbean island of Montserrat, is well known for its lava 
        dome complex at the summit of the volcano, which has gone through phases of growth and collapse. 
        As viscous lava is not very fluid, it cannot flow away from the vent easily when it is extruded. 
         it piles up on top of the vent forming a large, dome-shaped mass of material.

        This is a schematic diagram of a strato volcano, intended to illustrate the different layers of 
        different materials that comprise them. The purple colors are meant to represent ash layers, either 
        the products of fall-out from big eruption clouds or the products of pyroclastic flows. Notice that 
        these ash layers tend to be thin but widespread. The orange colors represent lava flows, and note that 
        some of them have cinder cones associated with them at the vent. The green colors are meant to represent 
        lava domes, and notice that they do not flow very far. Each eruption, regardless of what it produces, is 
        fed from the magma chamber by a dike. Most dikes come up through the center of the volcano and therefore
         most eruptions occur from at or near the summit. However, some dikes head off sideways to feed eruptions
          on the flanks.

            This is a pit that has been dug into the ground at Cotopaxi, a big strato volcano near Quito, 
            the capital city of Ecuador. The pit is about 2 meters deep and in it you can clearly see a 
            number of ash layers exposed. It is also easy to see that the layers are different - some are
             coarse and others are fine, some are dark-colored and others are light-colored.

            The lava at strato volcanoes occasionally forms 'a'a, but more commonly it barely flows at all, 
            preferring to pile up in the vent to form volcanic domes. Some strato volcanoes are just a collection
             of domes piled up on each other. Strato volcanoes are commonly found along subduction-related 
             volcanic arcs, and the magma supply rates to strato volcanoes are lower. This is the cause of 
             the cooler and differentiated magma compositions and the reason for the usually long repose periods 
             between eruptions. Examples of strato volcanoes include Mt. St. Helens, Mt. Rainier, Pinatubo, Mt. 
             Fuji, Merapi, Galeras, Cotopaxi, and super plenty others.
